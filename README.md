# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
* Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. 
* Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
MongoDB is the database we intend to use, and possibly integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. The train-test-split function from the SciKitLearn library is used to setup our training and testing. Random Forest Regression was used to complete the training.

## Dashboard
Our fully functioning and interactive dashboard will be hosted on Tableau or by utilizing a Flask template which would integrate D3.js. However, at this time we are unsure which one will be best suited for the presentation of analysis.
